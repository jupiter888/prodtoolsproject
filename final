## Content is important! {.vcenter}
In this presentation you will know how to create ~~cool~~ project for the productivity tools classes and how easy it is to do!  

First of all let's find out what a solid project should contain:  

* Some kind of interactive plot
* A map
* A table  

We'll look at each of them in more detail, do not worry.


## But how can I do this complicated things?

For all of this we gonna use R Markdown.  
I will not describe all the advantages of R Markdown,
because the purpose of this presentation is to teach you how to make a project.

If you want to learn more about R Markdown, just Google it. 
There is a lot of information and documentation on the web that will help you.  
Or just click [here.](http://letmegooglethat.com/?q=What+is+Rmarkdown%3F)  
Also, at the end of this presentation, there will be a link to the github repository, where you can find the source code of this presentation and several useful cheatsheets.

## Interactive plot {.smaller}

<font size="3">
The main advantage of interactive plot is the ability ~~to do things~~ to interact(zoom in, review individual sections, and so on.) with plot.
</font>

```{r warning = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(plotly, warn.conflicts = FALSE)

p <- ggplot(data = iris, 
            mapping = aes(x = Species, y = Sepal.Length)) +
  geom_bar(position = 'dodge', stat = "identity")

ggplotly(p = p)
```

## Map {.smaller}

<font size="3">
Here is the simple example of interactive map(which was buildedalso with basic R dataset). Unfortunately there is only one basic R data set with coordinates.  
So if you want to portray something different you will have to search for data.
</font>

```{r}
library(leaflet)
library(magrittr)

leaflet(data = quakes[1:50,]) %>% 
  addTiles() %>%
  addMarkers(lng = ~long, 
             lat = ~lat, 
             popup = ~as.character(x = mag), 
             label = ~as.character(x = mag))
```

## Table {.smaller}

And here is the example of interactive table with basic R data set.

```{r}

library(DT)

datatable(data = swiss,
          options = list(pageLength = 10),
          class = 'cell-border stripe',
          editable = 'cell')
```

## Is that it?

Yes, it is!
If you are familiar with the tools and packages that were used here, then creating such a presentation will take you no more than half an hour.  
And, as a begginers, who met all these things for the first time, we can assure you that **you are also capable of doing this**!
